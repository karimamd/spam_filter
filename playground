prediction function should:
1-take email as input
2-tokenize and stem it
3-get probability of each word in spam and non spam mails
    if word is not available in one then probability is 1/total number of words (or total in spam and non spam separately)
4-calculate probability of spam and non spam by multiplying probabilities of each word
5-choosing the heights value as the determinant


probability tables:

we need to calculate probability of each word in our dictionary in spam/ham mails
1-search for word in list of spam words (list called spam) and lists of ham words(eham and hham) and see how many times these are
probable (number of occurrence of word  /   number of occurrence of all words in spam/ham mail ?)
number of occurrence of all words == total number of words in all mails (stop words are excluded)

*maybe we will need to sort lists of tuples(spam/eham/hham) alphabetically to search for words easily
