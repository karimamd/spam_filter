prediction function should:
1-take email as input
2-tokenize and stem it
3-get probability of each word in spam and non spam mails
    if word is not available in one then probability is 1/total number of words (or total in spam and non spam separately)
4-calculate probability of spam and non spam by multiplying probabilities of each word
5-choosing the heights value as the determinant
